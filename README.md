# DSPRED
DSPRED is a two-stage hybrid classifier for predicting one-dimensional structure of proteins such as secondary structure, solvent accessibility and torsion angle classes. It employs a committee of dynamic Bayesian networks at the first stage and a support vector machine at the second stage. The feature sets of DSPRED include position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) and structural profile matrices derived by PSI-BLAST and HHblits.
