export HHLIB=${INSTALL_BASE_DIR}
export PATH=${PATH}:${INSTALL_BASE_DIR}/bin:${INSTALL_BASE_DIR}/scripts
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${INSTALL_BASE_DIR}/lib/ffindex/src/mpq

7. source ~/.bashrc
8. cd build (the folder under the source tree. if does not exist first generate this folder using mkdir build under source tree)
9. Update the MPI libraries

sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev
pip install mpi4py
